The purpose of this project was to create a summary DataFrame that deliver the infomation needed about the performance of the company during 2019. It is  grouped by three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities with a line graph that shows total weekly fares for each city type for the weeks between January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019.

For the column of average fare per driver, rural cities also perform well than suburban and urban cities by 40% and 230%. The reason is that the rides and drivers count of rural cities, significantly lower than urban and suburban cities. It leads to average values greater than urban and suburban.

In that line chart, Urban cities have highest total fares all the time, and Rural cities are lowest all over time. Suburban's line is in the middle.

2.Furthermore, the urban's line shows there are several peaks in March and April. At the same time, the line of rural shows some correlation to Urban's line. For example in the first week of March, urban's total fares are over 2,500 dollars. In parallel to that, rural's line reaches the lowest point, less than 360 dollars.
